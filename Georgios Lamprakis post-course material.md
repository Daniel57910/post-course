# Post-Course ( an opinionated personal approach )
The following document demonstrates my approach to preparation for a job after Makers Course. 
Because not everyone is on the same page, I will explain my situation and what helped me by sharing thoughts and of course resources.

## Background
In 2011 I graduated from a Greek University holding a computer science degree. I had a shallow previews coding experience but I had never worked on a big project. 
After Makers I got a job as junior software Engineer. The main language was **Java**. I had done a bit of java at Uni but at the time I got the job I had forgotten almost everything. 

I had 20 days to familiarize myself with the technology the company was using, but that was NOT compulsory. Any preparation was up to me. 

The following list was compiled right after I accepted the offer and had to do with the technology that the team I would be joining was dealing with at that moment of time.

## Technology
* Java
* JUnit / Spock (testing frameworks)
* Spring / Spring Boot (dependency injection frameworks)
* Concept of Microservices
* Casandra DB
* Kubernetes, Docker, AWS (DevOps)

## Preparation
The main goal of our final project at Makers was to teach our selves a new language and build something within 2 weeks. 

I felt that this approach wouldn't be 100% appropriate since I needed a deep understanding of the technology I would be using in my day to day job. Copying and pasting code that I didn't entirely understand wouldn't be ideal, so I decided to work for Java as I did during the pre-course for Ruby.

I tried to find a resource that would be similar to *A well grounded Rubyist* which I found very helpful in order to get a deeper understanding of how Ruby work.

Since the clock was ticking I didn't have enough time to investigate thoroughly but the resources I found for Java were good enough to get me started.

# Web Application Architecture

## Outcomes/Objectives

- I can identify the different components of a full stack web application
- I can explain why we might structure different applications in different ways
- I can diagram how a user action gets resolved in technical terms through different bits of the stack

## Demonstration

Think about some things that you might be concerned about when building an application. Brainstorm this on the board.

## Run through some examples

- I want to read some content
- I want to list to music or watch a video
- I want to chat to somebody
- I want to search for somewhere to live
- I want to manage my time using a calendar and share that with others

For each example, get then to brainstorm some things that you should be concerned about. Then get then to diagram out how they think the application should fit together. (3 teams?)

5 minutes for each diagramming session, then discuss - what did they miss? What might be need to think about.

Write up the results in a post as you go, and then share this. At the end, get them to vote on 3 things from the list that they are most unsure about. Can run future sessions based around these.

## Focuses
- Technically, where data lives - database, documents, caches, session, cookies, local storage
- Topologically, where does data live - cloud, VM, local?
- How do I know WHO somebody is?
- How quickly can I return information
- How many people can access my website at the same time
